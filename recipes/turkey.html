<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This is a great recipe for smoked turkey. A barbecue grill is nearly impossible to cook a large bird. A smoker is best for this. I prefer hickory chips or hickory wood. Hickory generates a more even smokiness than other woods, and it does not matter whether the wood is green or seasoned. Mesquite, if not well seasoned, will generate a creosote type coating because of the sap that oozes out of the wood while cooking.</p>
<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons seasoned salt</li>
    <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
    <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans cola-flavored carbonated beverage</li>
    <li>1 apple, quartered</li>
    <li>1 onion, quartered</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h5>Steps</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C).

    </li>
    <li>Rinse turkey under cold water, and pat dry. Rub the crushed garlic over the outside of the bird, and sprinkle with seasoned salt. Place in a disposable roasting pan. Fill turkey cavity with butter, cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and ground black pepper. Cover loosely with foil.</li>
    <li>Smoke at 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C) for 10 hours, or until internal temperature reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C) when measured in the thickest part of the thigh. Baste the bird every 1 to 2 hours with the juices from the bottom of the roasting pan.</li>
</ol>
