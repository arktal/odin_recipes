Odin Project recipes
This is my first project from The Odin Project, which is to create a basic HTML website containing three different recipes.
The first part cover HTML foundations, in which I learned :
- How to make a HTML boilerplate
- How to create paragraphs, titles, ordered/unordered lists, links and add image into a web page
- The importance of adding an alternate text to images
- The difference between <strong> and <b>, and between <em> and <i>
