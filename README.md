Odin Project recipes
This repository will contain all the "recipes" I will do while following The Odin Project course.
The first part cover HTML foundations, in which I learned :
- How to make a HTML boilerplate
- How to create paragraphs, titles, ordered/unordered lists, links and add image into a web page
- The importance of adding an alternate text to images
- The difference between <strong> and <b>, and between <em> and <i>
